This project is a Car Rental platform focused on Davao City, designed to connect users with available vehicles for their specified rental time and date. The application provides users with a list of available cars along with the sellerâ€™s information, facilitating easy bookings. Additionally, there is a dedicated seller page where car owners can list their vehicles, manage availability, and update rental dates, ensuring a seamless experience for both renters and sellers.
